        <li>5 medium tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>

        <li>1/2 tbsp ground sumac/li>
        <li>1 tsp Aleppo chili flakes, plus more for sprinkling</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground allspice</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>150g fatty ground lamb, or beef</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the dough, first, you warm the milk, ideally in a microwave on high heat for no more than 30 seconds. In a large bowl whisk together the flour, instant dry yeast, light brown sugar, and salt. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add to it one large egg, warmed milk, and extra virgin olive oil. Knead for five to six minutes until you have a smooth and elastic dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in a warm place to prove for two hours until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into four equal portions and then shape each piece into a ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the dough is resting, place a baking tray inside the oven and set it to preheat at 250°C/480°F. To make the topping first slice the tomatoes in half, then remove the seeds and squeeze out the juice. Place all the ingredients that make the topping, except meat, in a food processor until well combined. Now, incorporate the meat and pulse until the mixture turns into a paste.</li>
        <li>To assemble, lightly flour a ball of dough, then roll it into a thin round. Place the round on a piece of baking paper and brush the edges with olive oil. Arrange the topping evenly all over the dough, then gently press it in taking care that you do not tear it.</li>
        <li>Place the lahmacun with the baking paper into the baking tray and bake for five to six minutes. Repeat this last step with the remaining dough and topping.</li>
